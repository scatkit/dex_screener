# PROJECT SCOPE

1. Token discovery: fetch and list Solana tokens:
    * Connect to Solana Blockchain to monitor liquidity pool and swaps via programs' ID:
        a. Each DEX is a smart contract (Solana programm) and has a program ID - check against the known IDs of DEXs (e.g Raydium, Orca)
        b. Monitor liquidity pools created on a DEX (each pool ID is a pair)
        

        
    * Add token as soon as they are added to a liquidity pool and have at least one transaction .
